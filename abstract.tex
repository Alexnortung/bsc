% Neural networks
This thesis introduces neural networks and how some popular layers operate.
% Effeciency from GPUs
Neural networks can utilize a lot of parallelism, which makes them ideal to run and train on GPUs.
% Library
The high-level functional language Futhark can generate effecient data-parallel code, which can run on GPUs.
In this thesis Futhark is used to develop a library to handle neural networks.
% Optimizations
The library has room for improvements, especially for optimizations, but overall provides a nice interface.
The thesis will also give a high-level intuition of how automatic differentiation works.
And with the added support of automatic differentiation in Futhark it can be used in the library.
